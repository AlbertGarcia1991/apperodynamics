# Apperodynamics

## Description
The current repository hosts a personal project developed with the upskilling both JS web development and Reinforcement Learning. 
The goal is to deploy a website to show how potential flow works around basic and custom made elementary solutions and custom shapes. Also, we will add Reinforcement Learning algorithms to optimize the shape of different bodies to optimize certain metrics, while showing how the algorithm works in a educative fashion.

## Usage
UNDER DEVELOPMENT - NOT DEPLOYED YET

## Features
* Scrollable and zoomable space
* Addition, edition, and removal of basic elementary solutions

## Versions
* **0.1**: WIP

## To Do
* Make scrolling and zoom work
* Add parametric shapes
* Add custom shapes via coordinates file
* Add potential flow solver
* Generate v0 UI
* Boundary layer properties
* Reinforcement Learning 101
